# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# seed data
# User.create!(:first_name => "Mark", :last_name => "Francisco", :username => "mark", :email => "m@example.com", :password => "password")
# User.create!(:first_name => "Test", :last_name => "User", :username => "username2", :email => "t@example.com", :password => "password")
